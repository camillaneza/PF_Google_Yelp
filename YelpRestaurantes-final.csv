I was suuuuuuuper excited because we love the S Virginia location but it is a few miles drive. This location is less than 1-mile from our home. A little after returning from the park we placed a pickup order for combo #3. We were told it'll take about 25-minutes. The food was ready when we arrived which was about 5-minutes after their estimated time.

When we got home, my boyfriend was immediately disapppointed because the meat in the slider was a lot smaller compared to what we are used to from the other location. He also mentioned that the chicken had more ""grizzler"" than the chicken. And the tender was also small. We could normally share a combo plate because the portion were amazing, but not this time. I took a couple of bites of the small tender just to taste and it was just okay--it was dry and actually cold. I wonder if they cooked the chicken in advance, freeze them, then refry. Who knows! All we know is our order tonight was not even close to the quality from the original location. My boyfriend even said it ""has to be the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had"". We are deeply disappointed that this location didn't live up to the standard of the original location.

It was hard to tell if it was open since I didn't see any ""open"" signs or lights on but you can sure tell it's open by the wonderful aroma of chicken as you walk up to the place. 

I ordered the Combo #1 which is 2 giant tenders served with bread and pickles. I substituted slaw for fries.  Based on a prior review regarding the heat, I ordered mine mild but would've ordered medium if I had to do it again. There was pretty much no heat to the mild version. Great flavor with the breading on the really large tenders, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Served with their dipping sauce which was tasty as well.

There are a few kinks that might need to be worked out, but nothing super serious.

My sandwich was pretty spicy, but I'm one of those weirdos that buys Pepper X hot sauces, so for the layman you could probably call it Crazy Hot. It got my nose running, and that's more than I can say for any other chicken place I've tried in town. But mostly, it was delicious. And HUGE! For ~$8, it's quite a deal.

                            Restaurant review 1 - Arelis Restaurant


  For my first Restaurant review I went to eat in Arelis Restaurant which is in Camden NJ 2198 River Road street. Arelis restaurant is a Spanish restaurant where their most popular servings are mostly white, yellow Spanish rice with chicken. The Hispanics who run the restaurant are Dominicans so they also had foods from the Dominican Republic such as ""platano"" and ""magoo"". Not only did Arelis serve Spanish food, but they also serve food that are common in America such as Cheesesteak, Spaghetti, Cheese burgers and French fries. They also serve seafood such as fish and shrimp. Arelis restaurant was pretty small, it had a large painting of a very green forest with a river in it in the middle and on the right had the flags of a lot of Hispanic countries like Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican, ect. It also has the American flag.
    I went to eat at Arelis Restaurant, Saturday February 25, 2017 in approximately 3:00 pm. It is a small restaurant with only about 5-6 tables and I decided to sit on the empty one. It being such a small restaurant, a busy one especially on Saturdays, it took quite a while for one of the waitresses to notice me especially since at that time they were understaffed. However, as more waitresses arrive to work I was able to get served a little earlier than usual. One of the waitresses that served me was a young girl who I personally know that comes through as a member at my job at the Kroc center. Before I ordered we had a small conversation about our lives. After our small conversation, I was ready to order and through their menu I picked Spaghetti with shrimp since I was in the mood for Pasta. After picking Spaghetti with shrimp as my food of choice the waitress asked if there was any drinks that I wanted. For my drink, I picked sprite soda since I was in a mood for something sugary. The waitress wrote it down and told me the food will be ready in about 20 minutes. As I was waiting for my food, the restaurant was getting more crowded to the point where there weren't some seats left for some of the custumers. After about 20 minutes, my meal arrived and I had about a medium-large size yellow Spaghetti. I found the spaghetti shrimp to be very delicious and it took me maybe less than 10 minutes to demolish my whole plate. 
    After eating at Arelis restaurant, I would definitely come back and eat there again. However, I would recommend coming around the afternoon around 2 or 3 o'clock if you are the type that likes to have a quick service. If you are the type of person who likes eating at big restaurants and have a quick service then would not recommend you to go o Arelis. If you don't mind eating at a small restaurant but just like to be one of the few custumers that receives a quick service I would recommend to go there around the weekdays where it is less busy. I am definitely a fan of Arelis restaurant and will return to eat there!",2017,3,2,Arelis Restaurant,2198 River Ave,Camden,Florida,2.5,7,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'none'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True'}",Restaurants

As someone had mentioned among the comments, it did have a grandparents' home feeling to it. As a kid, I vaguely remember being weighed on the scale to determine the cost of my meal.

server was super friendly, ""complaining"" that the group of 5 adults with 2 preschoolers were being ""too quiet"" LOL.

the establishment has plenty of 2- to 4-seaters, two round tables for bigger groups. so if you have a larger party, might be nice to plan ahead.

they serve ice cream and stuff too, have a whole setup going on. would be nice for an afternoon treat.
