However, the restaurant is ridiculously understaffed and the orders consistently take more than 30 minutes to fulfil. In my opinion, there is no excuse for that. If you want to wait an hour and a half for alright food, this is the place for you. If you are anything like me and expect the food to be prepared in a reasonable amount of time, then stay clear of the Crazy D's on university terrace. 

This Crazy D's is a huge disappointment. I have been to the restaurant numerous times and only once has my food been prepared in 20-30 minutes, which is still excessive. I would recommend Cane's or Chick-Fil-A before Crazy D's. Their quality may not be as high but at least you will get your food before the day passes.

I was suuuuuuuper excited because we love the S Virginia location but it is a few miles drive. This location is less than 1-mile from our home. A little after returning from the park we placed a pickup order for combo #3. We were told it'll take about 25-minutes. The food was ready when we arrived which was about 5-minutes after their estimated time.

When we got home, my boyfriend was immediately disapppointed because the meat in the slider was a lot smaller compared to what we are used to from the other location. He also mentioned that the chicken had more ""grizzler"" than the chicken. And the tender was also small. We could normally share a combo plate because the portion were amazing, but not this time. I took a couple of bites of the small tender just to taste and it was just okay--it was dry and actually cold. I wonder if they cooked the chicken in advance, freeze them, then refry. Who knows! All we know is our order tonight was not even close to the quality from the original location. My boyfriend even said it ""has to be the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had"". We are deeply disappointed that this location didn't live up to the standard of the original location.

We will be back at Crazy D's, HOWEVER, it will only be at the original location. Sadly, this location was a let down.

It was hard to tell if it was open since I didn't see any ""open"" signs or lights on but you can sure tell it's open by the wonderful aroma of chicken as you walk up to the place. 

I ordered the Combo #1 which is 2 giant tenders served with bread and pickles. I substituted slaw for fries.  Based on a prior review regarding the heat, I ordered mine mild but would've ordered medium if I had to do it again. There was pretty much no heat to the mild version. Great flavor with the breading on the really large tenders, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Served with their dipping sauce which was tasty as well.

It's sweet, almost like if Cane's sauce, mayo, and honey mustard had a delicious, delicious baby. The online ordering process was pretty easy and simple, and my food was ready earlier than promised. 

There are a few kinks that might need to be worked out, but nothing super serious. I asked for my sauce to be on the side in the comments since this was my first time here and I wasn't sure if I'd like it. Instead, I got sauce on the fries PLUS an extra side of sauce. No big deal because I ended up liking it, but if I didn't I'd be pretty annoyed. Also, the cashier seemed really confused about my order.
